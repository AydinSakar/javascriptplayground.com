The JavaScript Playground used to run under a CMS, but now runs on Jekyll, the static site generator. The site is hosted [in a Github repository](https://github.com/jackfranklin/javascriptplayground.com) which means anyone can submit changes or even new articles through the means of a pull request.

To do this, you should create your own fork of the repository, make your changes, and then create a pull request.

If you're planning to write an article, I suggest you contact me first (@Jack_Franklin, jack at jackfranklin dot net). I'm always open to contributions but I am always working on new posts of my own, so it's a good idea to check so you don't write something I'm about to publish and hence your effort be wasted.

The post you write should have a block of YAML at the front that looks like this:

    ---
    layout: post
    title: "My Post Title"
    author: Jack Franklin
    author_twitter: jack_franklin
    ---
  
By adding the `author` and `author_twitter` fields, you post will be accredited to you, and not to me!
