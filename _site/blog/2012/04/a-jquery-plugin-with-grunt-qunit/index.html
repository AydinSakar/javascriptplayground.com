    <h1> A jQuery Plugin with Grunt &amp; QUnit </h1>
    <p class="post_date"><span>Posted: </span>27 April 2012</p>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>Today we&#8217;re going to take a look at writing a jQuery plugin. There&#8217;s a number of different ways to go about structuring jQuery plugins &amp; hence a lot of tutorials differ. I&#8217;ll show you how I would do it but also show examples of how others would do it &amp; link you to alternative views. Along with developing the plugin, we will test it with unit tests through QUnit (my new favourite thing <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/javascript-testing-qunit-1'>which I covered a couple of weeks back</a>) and build it all with Grunt.js, <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/grunt-js-command-line-tutorial'>which I covered last week</a>. I&#8217;ll be presuming some basic knowledge of jQuery, QUnit &amp; Grunt; if you&#8217;re not familiar with either Grunt or QUnit, those links above to previous tutorials should get you going.</p>

<p>To write this tutorial, I wanted to come up with a proper idea for a plugin and I decided to take a look at the first jQuery plugin I ever wrote, which was called &#8220;jQuote&#8221;. This plugin takes some text &amp; creates a quote from it as a <code>blockquote</code> element, the idea being then it can be styled as a pull quote, much like you see in magazines. This plugin was written as my first and consequently I don&#8217;t like it. Today I&#8217;m going to show you how I&#8217;d go about rewriting it, more effectively and with unit tests. In fact, I won&#8217;t even test it in the browser until the very end, as all the development will be test driven.</p>

<p>So, the first thing I&#8217;m going to do is set up a new directory for my plugin, which this time round is going to be called jQuery PullQuote. I create a Git repository, and then run <code>grunt init:jquery</code> to set up a new jQuery plugin project. Grunt asks me questions about my project &amp; after answering them I&#8217;m left with a project set up. I then add them all to Git and here&#8217;s what Grunt&#8217;s made for me:</p>

<pre><code>create mode 100644 LICENSE-GPL
create mode 100644 LICENSE-MIT
create mode 100644 README.md
create mode 100644 grunt.js
create mode 100644 libs/jquery/jquery.js
create mode 100644 libs/qunit/qunit.css
create mode 100644 libs/qunit/qunit.js
create mode 100644 package.json
create mode 100644 src/jquery.pullquote.js
create mode 100644 test/jquery.pullquote.html
create mode 100644 test/jquery.pullquote_test.js</code></pre>

<p>You can see it&#8217;s given me everything I need. Making a jQuery plugin means we should use QUnit, as QUnit is the testing framework of choice for jQuery. Lets head into <code>src/jquery.pullquote.js</code> and get coding. Grunt gives us a bit of a framework:</p>

<pre><code>/*
 * jquery.pullquote
 * https://github.com/jackfranklin/jquery.pullquote
 *
 * Copyright (c) 2012 Jack Franklin
 * Licensed under the MIT, GPL licenses.
 */

(function($) {

  // Collection method.
  $.fn.awesome = function() {
    return this.each(function() {
      $(this).html(&#39;awesome&#39;);
    });
  };

  // Static method.
  $.awesome = function() {
    return &#39;awesome&#39;;
  };

  // Custom selector.
  $.expr[&#39;:&#39;].awesome = function(elem) {
    return elem.textContent.indexOf(&#39;awesome&#39;) &gt;= 0;
  };

}(jQuery));</code></pre>

<p>I&#8217;m going to be using the first approach:</p>

<pre><code>$.fn.pullQuote = function(opts) {
  opts = $.extend({}, $.fn.pullQuote.options, opts);
};


$.fn.pullQuote.options = {
  outputClass: &quot;pullquote&quot;,
  outputElem: &quot;blockquote&quot;,
  insertAfter: &quot;elem&quot;
};</code></pre>

<p>In one step there a fair amount has happened, so lets take a moment to have a look. I&#8217;ve set up my function as <code>$.fn.pullQuote</code> which means it gets called on a jQuery collection, for example: <code>$(&quot;span&quot;).pullQuote();</code>. You can also pass in an optional object of options. The line:</p>

<pre><code>opts = $.extend({}, $.fn.pullQuote.options, opts);</code></pre>

<p>Takes anything I have in <code>opts</code>, overrides that property in <code>$.fn.pullQuote.options</code> and stores the formed object into <code>opts</code>, which overrides the <code>opts</code> passed into the function.</p>

<p>The reasoning for doing this is so people can override our defaults on a global level. If this plugin is being used 3-4 times, it&#8217;s quicker to change <code>$.fn.pullQuote.options</code> than pass it into <code>$(&quot;span&quot;).pullQuote()</code> every time. However, I&#8217;ve written this code, but not tested it! Lets quickly write some tests:</p>

<pre><code>test(&quot;defaults&quot;, function() {
  ok($.fn.pullQuote.options, &quot;options set up correctly&quot;);
  equal($.fn.pullQuote.options.insertAfter, &quot;elem&quot;, &quot;default global options are set&quot;);
  $.fn.pullQuote.options.insertAfter = &quot;test&quot;;
  equal($.fn.pullQuote.options.insertAfter, &quot;test&quot;, &quot;can change the defaults globally&quot;);
});</code></pre>

<p>You can run them through grunt with <code>grunt qunit</code>. Alternatively, you can run <code>grunt watch</code> and it will run the tests for you when save a file. Those tests all pass, so we&#8217;re on the right track.</p>

<p>From now on, I&#8217;ll write the tests first, as I should. Because our plugin interacts with DOM elements, I need to create some test HTML for us to work with. QUnit lets us put this in a <code>div</code> with an id of <code>qunit-fixture</code>. We can then get at this HTML in our tests, so this is a useful way to test plugins that interact with &amp; manipulate the DOM. I&#8217;m going to create <code>span</code> with some text. The plugin should take this text and add a new quote after the <code>h2</code>.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;div id=&quot;qunit-fixture&quot;&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;this is some text &lt;span&gt;with a totally awesome quote&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;div&gt;&lt;h2&gt;Quote&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>

<p>The first thing I want to ensure is that my plugin is chainable. People should be able to do <code>$(&quot;span&quot;).pullQuote().fadeOut().addClass(&quot;foo&quot;)</code>, as they can with all jQuery methods. Here&#8217;s the test I use:</p>

<pre><code>test(&quot;chainable&quot;, function() {
  ok($(&quot;p span&quot;).pullQuote().addClass(&quot;testing&quot;), &quot;can be chained&quot;);
  equal($(&quot;p span&quot;).attr(&quot;class&quot;), &quot;testing&quot;, &quot;class was added correctly from chaining&quot;);
});</code></pre>

<p>The logic here is to call PullQuote, then add a class, and then check that the element was indeed given that. Passing this test is easy. After our <code>opts = $.extend();</code> line, add in:</p>

<pre><code>return this.each(function() {
});</code></pre>

<p><code>this</code> refers to the collection the plugin was called on as a jQuery object, so by returning it we&#8217;re returning the jQuery object which means we can chain. Within the <code>each</code> is where we&#8217;ll add the code to make it work.</p>

<p>So now we&#8217;ve got the basics out the way, I want to write the tests in their entirity for the functionality. I&#8217;ve set up my test HTML in <code>#qunit-fixture</code> so I&#8217;ll use that for the tests. I want to take the text within the <code>span</code> and create a new element after the <code>h2</code>.</p>

<pre><code>test(&quot;functionality&quot;, function() {
  $(&quot;p span&quot;).pullQuote({
    insertAfter: &quot;div h2&quot;
  });
  ok($(&quot;div blockquote&quot;).length, &quot;the blockquote has been created&quot;);
  equal($(&quot;div blockquote&quot;).text(), &quot;with a totally awesome quote&quot;, &quot;it gets the right text&quot;);
  ok($(&quot;div blockquote&quot;).hasClass(&quot;pullquote&quot;), &quot;applies class correctly&quot;);

});</code></pre>

<p>This checks that <code>div blockquote</code> is now valid, because after <code>pullQuote</code> is called it should create that for us. It then makes sure the text matches, and that it has the class set in the options. I also want to write tests to check the defaults can be overwritten fine:</p>

<pre><code>test(&quot;changing defaults&quot;, function() {
  $(&quot;p span&quot;).pullQuote({
    insertAfter: &quot;div h2&quot;,
    outputClass: &quot;testQuote&quot;,
    outputElem: &quot;p&quot;
  });
  ok($(&quot;div p.testQuote&quot;).length, &quot;the blockquote has been created&quot;);
  equal($(&quot;div p.testQuote&quot;).text(), &quot;with a totally awesome quote&quot;, &quot;it gets the right text&quot;);
});</code></pre>

<p>That does much the same as the prior tests, but this time overriding the defaults &amp; then checking the plugin took them into account. The actual code to implement this is really simple:</p>

<pre><code>return this.each(function() {
    var elem = $(this),
        text = elem.text(),
        newElem = $(&quot;&lt;&quot; + opts.outputElem + &quot;/&gt;&quot;, {
          &quot;class&quot;: opts.outputClass,
          text: text
        }).insertAfter(opts.insertAfter);
  });</code></pre>

<p>Line by line, we:</p>

<ol>
<li>Wrap the current item in a jQuery object,</li>

<li>Get the text &amp; store it.</li>

<li>Create a new element of the type the option is set as,</li>

<li>Add the class set in options &amp; the text we got earlier,</li>

<li>Insert it after whatever selector is in <code>insertAfter</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>Running the tests now should give you a full passing suite of 10 assertions.</p>

<p>Now this plugin is very basic, and there&#8217;s a lot more I want to expand on, but for now that will do, and I will revist this in the future. For now, lets imagine I want to release this onto Github. To do this, we&#8217;ll harness the power of Grunt. Run <code>grunt</code> in the command line. This will execute grunt&#8217;s default task, which by default will:</p>

<ol>
<li>Run the code through JSLint</li>

<li>Run the test suite</li>

<li>Concatenate all your JS src files into one.</li>

<li>Minify them.</li>
</ol>

<p>If at any stage there are errors (say your tests fail), it will stop. It&#8217;s now created the files <code>dist/jquery.pullquote.js</code> and <code>dist.jquery.pullquote.min.js</code> for us. Just like that. After that all I have to do is commit them, and then <a href='https://github.com/jackfranklin/jquery.pullquote'>push them to Github</a>.</p>

<p>I hope this article has shown you what I think is a good workflow for developing a jQuery Plugin, using Grunt to do a lot of the hard work for us (I absolutely love using Grunt) and writing Unit Tests. The functionality implemented here is very, very basic but I wanted this to serve as an introduction, I&#8217;ve got tutorials planned soon that attempt to implement much more complicated functionality. As always, please leave a comment &amp; I will get back to you.</p>
