    <h1> Introduction to JavaScript Objects </h1>
    <p class="post_date"><span>Posted: </span>04 June 2012</p>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>Today I&#8217;d like to talk a little bit about Objects in JavaScript. When I first started using JavaScript (my first experience of it was through jQuery), I was initially confused with this whole idea of passing in objects to functions, in particular to jQuery functions like <code>animate()</code> or <code>css()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$(foo).css({
	&quot;border&quot; : &quot;1px solid black&quot;,
	&quot;color&quot;  : &quot;red&quot;
});</code></pre>

<p>This always confused me, before I had a solid grasp on pure JavaScripts &amp; in particular JavaScript objects. If you&#8217;re writing lots of JavaScript, objects are going to be something you use frequently so it&#8217;s important as a beginner you make sure you&#8217;ve got a firm understanding of them.</p>

<p>So, firstly, how do we create an object? We can do it two ways:</p>

<pre><code>var x = new Object();
var y = {};</code></pre>

<p>Both of these mean exactly the same thing &amp; both simply instantiate an empty object. In reality, the vast majority of developers use the second method - it&#8217;s a lot shorter whilst still being clear as to what it does.</p>

<p>As a side note, this is identical to how we might create new arrays, either through <code>var z = new Array();</code> or through simply <code>var z = []</code>.</p>

<p>Now we have this object, we can define properties (or keys) and values. This can be done in a number of ways. You can create an empty object &amp; then add properties:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {};
x.foo = &quot;bar&quot;;
x[&quot;baz&quot;] = 123;</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice the two ways of assigning properties. You can either use the dot notation or the square brackets. The differences between the two are easily shown through this code snippet:</p>

<pre><code>//x = some object
var bar = &quot;foo&quot;
x.bar //looks for &quot;bar&quot; property in object &quot;x&quot;
x[bar] //looks for &quot;foo&quot; property in object &quot;x&quot;</code></pre>

<p>The first method will look for the property named whatever you place after the dot, whilst the square brackets will evaluate what&#8217;s inside. Hence, the square bracket notation is useful when you have the property you want to access stored within a variable, whilst if you know which property you want to get at, you&#8217;ll tend to use the dot notation.</p>

<p>However, you don&#8217;t have to create an empty object first, you can create an object &amp; define properties in one swoop:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	foo: &quot;bar&quot;,
	baz: 123	
}</code></pre>

<p>You do not need to put the properties of an object in quotes when declaring them <strong>except</strong> when using a reserved word in JavaScript. For example, you couldn&#8217;t do:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	class: 123
}</code></pre>

<p>If you wish to store a property that is also a reserved word, you need to quote it when declaring it:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	&quot;class&quot;: 123
}</code></pre>

<p>Note that from ECMAScript 5, reserved words <em>can</em> be used as properties without needing quotes, but that is only currently implemented in IE9, FF 3.5+ and Chrome 7+. If you wish to support prior versions of these browsers (and others, like Safari), quote your reserved word properties or, preferably, just don&#8217;t use them.</p>

<p>When declaring properties like this, note the use of commas. After the value for each <em>but the last</em> property, you need to add a comma. Leaving a comma on the last one, or missing one out, will result in errors. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll sometimes see people declare objects like this:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	  bar: 123
	, foo: 456
	, baz: &quot;abc&quot;
}</code></pre>

<p>Whilst I&#8217;m not a fan, that method does make it much easier to see if you&#8217;ve missed a comma or put one where you don&#8217;t need it. I personally prefer the more common approach that I use throughout this post, but if you prefer the other method, that&#8217;s fine. As usual, it&#8217;s down to personal preference.</p>

<p>To iterate over an object, we can use <code>forâ€¦in</code>:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	foo: &quot;bar&quot;,
	baz: 123	
}
for (prop in x) {
	console.log(prop, &quot;=&quot;, x[prop]);
}</code></pre>

<p>Which would output:</p>

<pre><code>foo=bar
baz=123</code></pre>

<p>Of course, properties of an object can contain functions (although functions inside an object are actually methods), too:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	add: function(a, b) {
			return a+b;
		}
};</code></pre>

<p>Which is then called as <code>x.add(1,2)</code> as you&#8217;d expect. A good thing to know is when a method is invoked, its scope is set to the object. For example:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	add: function() { console.log(this); },
	bar: 123
}
x.add();</code></pre>

<p>Logs:</p>

<pre><code>{ add: [Function], bar: 123 }</code></pre>

<p>And of course, objects can have objects in them:</p>

<pre><code>var x = {
	y: {
		add: function(a,b) { return a+b; },
		self: function() { console.log(this); }
	},
	bar: &quot;foo&quot;
}</code></pre>

<p>In this instance, <code>x.y.self()</code> would log <code>{ add: [Function], self: [Function] }</code>. Just to illustrate, I could call that method using the square bracket notation:</p>

<pre><code>x[&quot;y&quot;][&quot;self&quot;]();</code></pre>

<p>The reason you&#8217;ll often see APIs of libraries take an object as an input to a function is that it&#8217;s much easier than having multiple parameters and also allows you to only define those values you want to change. A jQuery plugin might have 5 options, with 5 defaults set. If you wanted to change just one of them but couldn&#8217;t pass an object into the plugin, you would probably have to pass in every value, even those you don&#8217;t want to change:</p>

<pre><code>$(foo).plugin(&quot;defaultVal&quot;, &quot;defaultVal&quot;, &quot;changedVal&quot;, &quot;defaultVal&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s also unclear what each of those options are, whereas if you can pass in an object:</p>

<pre><code>$(foo).plugin({
	someProp: &quot;changedVal&quot;
});</code></pre>

<p>The advantage is twofold: it&#8217;s clear what option you&#8217;re changing, and you don&#8217;t have to specify the defaults again. All we do here is pass an object directly into a function. You could, if you wanted, create it first:</p>

<pre><code>var opts = {
	someProp: &quot;changedVal&quot;
}
$(foo).plugin(opts);</code></pre>

<p>With that it&#8217;s time to bring this tutorial to a close. There is a lot more to cover, but this is all planned in an article next week titled &#8220;Object Oriented Programming in JavaScript&#8221;, which will pick up where this left off &amp; go much further, to hopefully show some real life usage of objects &amp; how powerful they can be. As always, if you have any questions please do leave a comment &amp; I will get back to you. The next article will be on Wednesday, June 6th where I&#8217;ll be demonstrating the use of Sockets with Node.js.</p>
