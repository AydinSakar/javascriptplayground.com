    <h1> A JS Playground Update </h1>
    <p class="post_date"><span>Posted: </span>14 May 2012</p>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>JavaScript Playground is now just over one month old, so I thought it would be a good time to write a quick post with some updates about the site.</p>

<p>Firstly, you will have noticed that the last post was a week ago, on the 7th. This can be attributed to the fact that for the next 3 weeks is exam period at University, and I&#8217;ve got 4 exams to take between now &amp; the end of May. This unfortunately takes a lot of my time up which means I haven&#8217;t been able to write at the usual pace. I hope to publish about once a week for the next few weeks before returning to the more frequent schedule from June onwards. If there&#8217;s something you&#8217;d like to see me cover, I&#8217;m always on the look out for ideas.</p>

<p>I also wanted to say thank you to everyone who has tweeted, upvoted, retweeted &amp; so on with links to the blog. In the first month JS Playground served over 50, 000 visits which for me personally is amazing, I never expected that to happen. If you&#8217;re interested in sponsoring the blog, I&#8217;m still looking for someone, so please do get in touch to discuss further.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s all I wanted to say, just a quick message to explain the slow down in content and also to say thank you to everyone who has helped, and I&#8217;m glad that the stuff I&#8217;m writing is proving beneficial to so many people.</p>
