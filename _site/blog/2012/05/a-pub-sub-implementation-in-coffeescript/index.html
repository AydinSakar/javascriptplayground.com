    <div class="post_body">
      <p>A while back I wrote about creating a <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/a-jquery-pub-sub-implementation'>Pub/Sub implementation in jQuery</a> and said that I&#8217;d revist the subject without relying on jQuery. Today I&#8217;m going to do that but once again use <a href='http://www.coffeescript.org'>CoffeeScript</a>. As always I will be Unit testing, this time with Mocha, the <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/05/a-jquery-plugin-in-coffeescript'>same library I covered in the last tutorial</a>. I will not be going over the very basics of using Mocha, so if you haven&#8217;t used it before, please read that post first. Similarly, I will not be covering basic CoffeeScript, so please refer to that article if you&#8217;re not familiar with the basics. For those not fans of CoffeeScript, in the future I&#8217;ll be writing this from scratch with just JavaScript. The reason I use CoffeeScript today is that I&#8217;ve had a lot of requests for it, so I thought I&#8217;d merge a tutorial on &#8220;Advanced Coffeescript&#8221; into this Pub/Sub one.</p>

<p>The Pub/Sub pattern (also known as the Observer pattern) is simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>You can subscribe to an event, and add a function to execute when that event is called.</li>

<li>You can publish events, invoking the functions of all the items subscribed to that event.</li>
</ol>

<p>It&#8217;s actually a very simple system to create. We&#8217;ll be using CoffeeScript&#8217;s class syntax to get this done. First however, I want to set up my testing. Create your <code>test/</code> and <code>src/</code> directories and add <code>pubsubtest.coffee</code> and <code>pubsub.coffee</code> to each of them respectively. Within your test file, add:</p>

<pre><code>chai = require &#39;chai&#39;
expect = chai.expect

{Pubsub} = require &#39;../src/pubsub&#39;</code></pre>

<p>Remembering you need Mocha &amp; Chai installed. Please see the previous tutorial I linked to above if you need to do this. Last time round I used Chai&#8217;s <code>should</code> syntax to do tests, which are done more in the BDD style:</p>

<pre><code>someVal.should.equal &quot;foo&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Today however I&#8217;m using Chai&#8217;s <code>expect</code> syntax, which gives me TDD style tests such as:</p>

<pre><code>expect(someVal).to.equal &quot;foo&quot;</code></pre>

<p>Personally I prefer the latter syntax, however use which ever one you prefer.</p>

<p>The last line includes my PubSub class, which we need to create before we do any more coding. Head into the source file and add:</p>

<pre><code>class Pubsub

root = exports ? window
root.Pubsub = Pubsub</code></pre>

<p>That code creates our new class &amp; exports it as <code>root.Pubsub</code>, so we can then get at it in our tests using <code>{Pubsub} = require(&#39;../src/pubsub.coffee&#39;)</code>.</p>

<p>The way this will work, is that the subscribe method should take three parameters, which are:</p>

<ol>
<li>The id of the item subscribing to the event, such as &#8220;module_chat&#8221;.</li>

<li>The event to subscribe to, such as &#8220;new_message&#8221;.</li>

<li>The function to execute when that event is published.</li>
</ol>

<p>I will store these in an object and then store all items that are subscribed to an event in an array, so my object might look like this:</p>

<pre><code>subs = {
	event1: [
		{ id: &quot;module1&quot;, callback: function() {} },
		{ id: &quot;module2&quot;, callback: function() {} }
	]
}</code></pre>

<p>So the next step is to write tests for these:</p>

<pre><code>describe &#39;a subscription&#39;, -&gt;
  myApp = new Pubsub
  it &#39;should add subscriptions to the object&#39;, -&gt;
    sub1 = myApp.sub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;, someFn
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;]).to.be.ok
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;].length).to.equal 1
  it &#39;it should add the id to the array for that event if the event already exists&#39;, -&gt;
    sub2 = myApp.sub &quot;elem2&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;, someFn
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;].length).to.equal 2</code></pre>

<p>The first spec says that when I add a new subscription, the object in <code>myApp</code>, called <code>subs</code>, should have a property in it called <code>myEvent</code>, and that should exist. The test <code>to.be.ok</code> checks it evaluates to true, which it will do unless it doesn&#8217;t even exist. I then check the length of <code>subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;]</code> to be one, which means there&#8217;s just one item in the array, which should be correct, as we&#8217;ve only added one subscription for this event.</p>

<p>The second spec says that if we add another subscription for a new event, it should add the item to the array in <code>subs[myEvent]</code>, so the array should have a length of 2. I could write further tests which check the specific data within the array, but for now that will be okay. I&#8217;m actually going to follow this up looking at our tests &amp; where we can improve them, but for now we will stick with some basic tests.</p>

<p>You can run these in the console with:</p>

<pre><code>mocha --compilers coffee:coffee-script -R spec</code></pre>

<p>I append <code>-R spec</code> on there to get an &#8220;RSpec&#8221; style output in the terminal. Right now they all fail. First steps is to set up a constructor to create our <code>subs</code> object. I use <code>@subs</code> here because in CoffeeScript, <code>@</code> is a shortcut for <code>this</code>. So <code>@subs</code> is <code>this.subs</code>:</p>

<pre><code>class Pubsub
  constructor: -&gt;
    @subs = {}</code></pre>

<p>When I started implementing the <code>sub</code> method, I decided to write a function to check if an event has any subscriptions or not, as it made sense. I denote this as <code>_isSubscribed</code>, with the underscore denoting to me that it&#8217;s not a method I expect anyone to use outside of the implementation. These are what I usually refer to as utility functions:</p>

<pre><code>_isSubscribed: (evt) -&gt;
	@subs[evt]?</code></pre>

<p>All we do is see if the key exists. Using CoffeeScript&#8217;s existential operator <code>?</code> we can check if a variable is defined &amp; not null. This is a really useful feature which I use a lot.</p>

<p>You may say you could just do <code>@subs[evt]?</code> wherever you need it, but I like to pull that out into a method as I&#8217;m sure I will need it lots. Perhaps you would rather not, but I like it, personally. But I don&#8217;t like having methods - albeit very simple ones - without tests, so in this case I tend to retrospectively write tests to double check my implementation:</p>

<pre><code>describe &#39;isSubscribed&#39;, -&gt;
  myApp = new Pubsub
  it &#39;should return false if evt is not in subs&#39;, -&gt;
    expect(myApp._isSubscribed(&quot;event1&quot;)).to.equal false
    myApp.sub &quot;elem2&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;, someFn
    expect(myApp._isSubscribed(&quot;event1&quot;)).to.equal false
  it &#39;should return true if evt is in subs&#39;, -&gt;
    sub1 = myApp.sub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;, someFn
    expect(myApp._isSubscribed(&quot;myEvent&quot;)).to.equal true</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s pretty simple, I just add some subscriptions, and check that it returns true or false correctly. Of course, this is tough to test without the <code>sub</code> method being implemented, so here goes:</p>

<pre><code>sub: (id, evt, cb) -&gt;
  if @_isSubscribed evt
    sub = @subs[evt]
    sub.push {id: id, callback: cb}
  else
    @subs[evt] = [{id: id, callback: cb}]</code></pre>

<p>The implementation is pretty simple:</p>

<ol>
<li>If the event already has a subscription, then add a new object to the subscription array for that event.</li>

<li>Else, create a new object &amp; add an array of just one object.</li>
</ol>

<p>If you run those tests now, we should be passing. The next thing I want to do is add a way to unsubscribe. Again, time for tests!</p>

<pre><code>describe &#39;unsubscribing&#39;,  -&gt;
  myApp = new Pubsub
  it &#39;should not error if removing a non existant subscription&#39;, -&gt;
    myApp.unSub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;
    expect(myApp.subs).to.eql {}

  it &#39;should remove subscription fine&#39;, -&gt;
    myApp.sub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;, someFn
    myApp.sub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent2&quot;, someFn
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;]).to.be.ok
    myApp.unSub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;myEvent&quot;
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent&quot;]).to.not.be.ok
    expect(myApp.subs[&quot;myEvent2&quot;]).to.be.ok</code></pre>

<p>The only line I want to highlight:</p>

<pre><code>expect(myApp.subs).to.eql {}</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;ll notice I use <code>eql</code> here rather than <code>equal</code>. This is because <code>equal</code> tests strict equality, whilst <code>eql</code> does not. In JavaScript:</p>

<pre><code>{} === {} //false
{} == {} //true</code></pre>

<p>So to check if my object is empty, I want to use <code>==</code>, which is what <code>eql</code> does. My implementation for <code>unSub</code> is:</p>

<pre><code>unSub: (id, evt) -&gt;
  return false if not @_isSubscribed evt
  newSubs = []
  for sub in @subs[evt]
    newSubs.push sub if sub.id isnt id
  if newSubs.length is 0
    delete @subs[evt]
  else
    @subs[evt] = newSubs</code></pre>

<p>This works like so:</p>

<ol>
<li>If <code>subs[evt]</code> does not exist, we don&#8217;t need to bother trying to unsubscribe as there cannot be something to unsubscribe from.</li>

<li>Else, we loop through all subscriptions for that event, and add any that are not the one we want to remove to the new array, <code>newSubs</code>. Then, if <code>newSubs</code> contains items, we set <code>@subs[evt]</code> to be the new array, else we remove it.</li>
</ol>

<p>Notice how I&#8217;m adding the conditional after the <code>return false</code>. You can do this with all conditionals in CoffeeScript. You see I do it again in the line <code>newSubs.push sub if sub.id isnt id</code>. I find for quick, one line conditionals, postfixing the conditional makes more sense to me. I also use <code>is</code>, which is compiled into <code>===</code>. If you try using <code>===</code> in your CoffeeScript, it wont compile, however if you use <code>==</code>, it will compile into <code>===</code>.</p>

<p>Now we pass the tests for that, lets write the tests for publishing events. I stumbled a bit here, as I wasn&#8217;t sure how best to check events had been fired. I came up with a system for doing this:</p>

<p>Create my test functions to set a variable to true, and then create a function to check if that variable is true or false. If it&#8217;s true, reset it to false, ready for the next test, and return true. If it&#8217;s not true, return false.</p>

<pre><code>fnDidFire = false

hasFired = -&gt;
  if fnDidFire
    fnDidFire = false
    return true
  else
    return false

someFn = -&gt;
  fnDidFire = true</code></pre>

<p>I also want to be able to pass data to callbacks, so I need to write another test variable &amp; function to check I&#8217;m passing in the extra information.</p>

<pre><code>extraCallbackInfo = {}
someFnWithInfo = (info) -&gt;
 fnDidFire = true
 extraCallbackInfo = info</code></pre>

<p>When I want to test passing data, I will use the function which sets <code>extraCallbackInfo</code> and then I&#8217;ll test on that.</p>

<p>So we can test the result of <code>hasFired()</code>, and if that&#8217;s true, we can be confident the function fired. Using this, I can write my tests:</p>

<pre><code>describe &#39;a publish&#39;, -&gt;
  myApp = new Pubsub
  myApp.sub &quot;elem1&quot;, &quot;event1&quot;, someFn
  it &#39;should fire the callback&#39;, -&gt;
    myApp.pub &quot;event1&quot;
    expect(hasFired()).to.be.ok

  it &#39;should send any extra data through with the callback&#39;, -&gt;
    myApp.sub &quot;elem2&quot;, &quot;event2&quot;, someFnWithInfo
    myApp.pub &quot;event2&quot;, foo: &quot;bar&quot;
    expect(hasFired()).to.be.ok
    expect(extraCallbackInfo.foo).to.equal &quot;bar&quot;

  it &#39;should not fire for an event that does not exist&#39;, -&gt;
    myApp.pub &quot;madeUpEvent&quot;
    expect(hasFired()).to.not.be.ok</code></pre>

<p>The implementation for this is actually very, very simple:</p>

<pre><code>pub: (evt, info) -&gt;
  for key, val of @subs
    return false if not val?
    if key is evt
      for data in val
        data.callback(info)</code></pre>

<ol>
<li>If <code>val</code> does not exist, don&#8217;t do anything.</li>

<li>Else, if <code>key</code> is <code>evt</code>, which means we have a match, loop through every item in the subscription array for that value.</li>

<li>Then, run the callback, passing in the extra data passed.</li>
</ol>

<p>With that, you should see a passing set of specs. It&#8217;s only a very simple implementation, but there is certainly room for improvements, both in the tests &amp; implementation.
