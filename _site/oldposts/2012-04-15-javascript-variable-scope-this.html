    <h1> Scope and this in JavaScript </h1>
    <p class="post_date"><span>Posted: </span></p>
    <div class="post_body">
      <p>Today I want to talk a little about scope in JavaScript and the <code>this</code> variable. The idea of &#8220;scope&#8221; is that it&#8217;s where certain functions or variables are accessible from in our code, &amp; the context in which they exist &amp; are executed in.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve ever seen someone do something like:</p>

<pre><code>function someFunc() {
  var _this = this;
  something.on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {
    console.log(_this);
  });
};</code></pre>

<p>And wondered what the <code>var _this=this;</code> is all about, hopefully this article should clear it all up.</p>

<p>The first scope is <strong>Global Scope</strong>. This is very easy to define. If a variable or function is <em>global</em>, it can be got at from anywhere. In a browser, the global scope is the <code>window</code> object. So if in your code you simply have:</p>

<pre><code>var x = 9;</code></pre>

<p>You&#8217;re actually setting the property <code>window.x</code> to 9 (when working in a browser). You could type <code>window.x = 9;</code> if you like, but because it&#8217;s the global object you don&#8217;t have to. Properties on the global object can be accessed from anywhere in our code.</p>

<p>The only other scope we can have is <strong>Local Scope</strong>. JavaScript scopes at a function level. For example:</p>

<pre><code>function myFunc() {
  var x = 5;
};
console.log(x); //undefined</code></pre>

<p>Since <code>x</code> was initialised within <code>myFunc()</code>, it is only accessible within <code>myFunc()</code>.</p>

<p><strong>A word of Caution</strong></p>

<p>If you declare a variable &amp; forget to use the <code>var</code> keyword, that variable is automatically made global. So this code would work:</p>

<pre><code>function myFunc() {
  x = 5;
});
console.log(x); //5</code></pre>

<p>This is a <strong>very bad idea</strong>. It&#8217;s considered bad practise to clutter the global scope. You should add as fewer properties as you possibly can to the global object. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;ll see libraries such as jQuery often do this:</p>

<pre><code>(function() {
  var jQuery = { /* all my methods go here */ };
  window.jQuery = jQuery.
})();</code></pre>

<p>Wrapping everything in a function which is then immediately invoked means all the variables within that function are bound to the <em>local scope</em>. At the very end you can then expose all your methods by binding the <code>jQuery</code> object to the <code>window</code>, the <em>global object</em>. Although I&#8217;ve simplified it hugely, this is in essence how the jQuery source works. If you want to learn more, <a href='http://paulirish.com/2010/10-things-i-learned-from-the-jquery-source/'>Paul Irish&#8217;s &#8220;10 Things I learned from the jQuery Source&#8221;</a> is a highly recommended watch.</p>

<p>Because local scope works through functions, any functions defined within another have access to variables defined in the outer function:</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
  var x = 5;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); //5 
  }
  inner();
}</code></pre>

<p>But the <code>outer()</code> function doesn&#8217;t have access to any variables declared within <code>inner()</code>:</p>

<pre><code>function outer() {
  var x = 5;
  function inner() {
    console.log(x); //5 
    var y = 10;
  }
  inner();
  console.log(y); //undefined
}</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s pretty much all there is too it at a basic level. Things get a bit more complex once we take a look at the <code>this</code> keyword in JavaScript and how it works. I&#8217;m sure we&#8217;ve all come across this issue:</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;myLink&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {
  console.log(this); //points to myLink (as expected)
  $.ajax({
    //ajax set up
    success: function() {
      console.log(this); //points to the global object. Huh?
    }
  });
});</code></pre>

<p><code>this</code> is a variable that is automatically set for you when a function is invoked. The value it&#8217;s given depends on how a function is invoked. In JavaScript we have a few main ways of invoking functions. I wont talk about them all today, but just the three ways most people use them; either when a function is called as a method, or on it&#8217;s own, or as an event handler. Depending on how a function is invoked, <code>this</code> is set differently:</p>

<pre><code>function foo() {
  console.log(this); //global object
};

myapp = {};
myapp.foo = function() {
  console.log(this); //points to myapp object
}

var link = document.getElementById(&quot;myId&quot;);
link.addEventListener(&quot;click&quot;, function() {
  console.log(this); //points to link
}, false);</code></pre>

<p>Those are all fairly obvious. The MDN has a <a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/DOM/element.addEventListener'>nice explanation</a> for the third &amp; why this happens:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>It is often desirable to reference the element from which the event handler was fired, such as when using a generic handler for a series of similar elements. When attaching a function using addEventListener() the value of this is changedâ€”note that the value of this is passed to a function from the caller.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So, now we know that, we are in a position to figure out why <code>var _this = this;</code> is required in the above code.</p>

<p>Doing <code>$(&quot;myLink&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {})</code> means that when the element is clicked, the function is fired. But this function is bound as an event handler, so <code>this</code> is set to the reference to the DOM element <code>myLink</code>. The success method you define within the Ajax request is <em>just a regular function</em>, and as such when it&#8217;s invoked, <code>this</code> is set to the global object, as it is when any function that&#8217;s not an event handler or an object method is.</p>

<p>The above is precisely why you&#8217;ll see a lot of people doing <code>var _this = this</code> or <code>var that = this</code> or similar, to store the current value. It&#8217;s also seen by many as what the correct value should be, but that debate is for another day.</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;myLink&quot;).on(&quot;click&quot;, function() {
  console.log(this); //points to myLink (as expected)
  var _this = this;  //store reference
  $.ajax({
    //ajax set up
    success: function() {
      console.log(this); //points to the global object. Huh?
      console.log(_this); //better!
    }
  });
});</code></pre>

<p>There are ways in which we can invoke functions by explicitly defining what the value of <code>this</code> should be, but as this has already ended up as a fairly long article, I&#8217;ll leave those for another day. If you have any questions, please do leave a comment &amp; I will get back to you.</p>
