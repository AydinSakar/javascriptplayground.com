<p>Something I will be focusing on on a regular basis here at JSP is producing tidy code that&#8217;s easier to maintain in the future as well as nicer to work with. One such area where people often produce messy code is when using jQuery&#8217;s <code>.css()</code> method.</p>

<p>Basic usage of this goes like so:</p>

<pre><code>$(elem).css(&quot;display&quot;); //returns value
$(elem).css(&quot;display&quot;, &quot;block&quot;); //sets value</code></pre>

<p>And in order to set multiple values, people will often do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(elem)
	.css(&quot;display&quot;, &quot;block&quot;)
	.css(&quot;border&quot;, &quot;1px solid blue&quot;)
	.css(&quot;background&quot;, &quot;#F00&quot;)
	{and so on}</code></pre>

<p>However this is the wrong way to do this, on so many levels. jQuery is written pretty cleverly, and <code>.css()</code> can take an object of properties &amp; their respective values:</p>

<pre><code>$(elem).css({
	&quot;border&quot; : &quot;1px solid blue&quot;,
	&quot;display&quot; : &quot;block&quot;,
	&quot;background&quot; : &quot;#F00&quot;
});</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that you don&#8217;t actually need the quotes around the properties (but you do around the values), this would be valid:</p>

<pre><code>$(elem).css({
	border: &quot;1px solid blue&quot;,
	{so on}
});</code></pre>

<p>However, you have to use quotes if you want to use a reserved word as a property. For example if you were creating a new element &amp; setting the class attribute:</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;&lt;div/&gt;&quot;, {
	class: &quot;myDiv&quot;
});</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s invalid, as <code>class</code> is a reserved word, so you&#8217;d have to do :</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;&lt;div/&gt;&quot;, {
	&quot;class&quot; : &quot;myDiv&quot;
});</code></pre>

<p>Because this always trips me up, I&#8217;ve simply gotten into the habit of always putting quotes around my property names in JS objects. This is more a personal preference than anything else, just pick what makes the most sense to you.</p>
