<p>I&#8217;ve teamed up with the lovely folks at Event Handler, who run an array of events in London, to run two JavaScript workshops in March 2013 which I&#8217;m really excited about.</p>

<p>The first is on March 6th and is titled <a href='http://www.eventhandler.co.uk/events/ldnjsnightclass-toolingcli'>Modern Tooling on the Command Line</a>. This workshop will run you through some of the powerful command line tools available to us that can really help speed up JavaScript development. We&#8217;ll start with a brief introduction to the command line and then move on to trying out some of the tools, such as Yeoman, Grunt, Bower and so on.</p>

<p>The second is on March 27th and is titled <a href='http://www.eventhandler.co.uk/events/ldnjsnightclass-buildingcli'>Building Command Line tools with Node</a>. In this workshop I want to demonstrate how you can use small tools like Node.js to piece together your own command line tools. Often I will write my own little tools to speed things up, and I think it&#8217;s something more people should do. We&#8217;ll build a few small tools, along with some bigger ones, and then also look at how we might publish our libraries to the Node Package Manager (npm).</p>

<p>To come along you&#8217;ll need a Mac of some sort or a machine running Linux. I simply don&#8217;t have the knowledge of Windos to be able to guarantee I can help with how to install things on Windows, unfortunately. Tickets cost Â£40 and are available at the above links. Both events are based at the Google Campus in London.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;re interested but would like to clarify something or ask me questions, please leave a comment and I&#8217;ll get back to you.</p>
