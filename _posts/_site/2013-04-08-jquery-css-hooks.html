<p>Did you know that jQuery gives you a way to write your own custom CSS methods? I didn&#8217;t until recently and I&#8217;d like to show you why they are useful in this short tutorial.</p>

<p>How many times have you wanted to do this:</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;div&quot;).css(&quot;margin&quot;, &quot;1px 2px 3px 4px&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>But have to set each individual direction value separately? I know I have. Using CSS Hooks, we can easily add the above functionality to jQuery.</p>

<p><strong>A word of warning: CSS Hooks were added in jQuery 1.4.3, so if you&#8217;re stuck on an older version (you really shouldn&#8217;t be by now) then this wont work.</strong></p>

<p>Lets set up the wrapper for our new margin CSS hook. What we&#8217;ll need to do is split the user&#8217;s input into 4 values, one for each direction. First, I can set up an array containing the four directions. You&#8217;ll see why this is important shortly:</p>

<pre><code>var directions = [&quot;Top&quot;, &quot;Right&quot;, &quot;Bottom&quot;, &quot;Left&quot;];</code></pre>

<p>Next, lets define our new &#8220;margin&#8221; hook. The hooks are stored as objects with two methods, <code>get</code> and <code>set</code>:</p>

<pre><code>$.cssHooks.margin = {
	get: function(elem) {
	},
	set: function(elem, value) {
	}
};</code></pre>

<p>Note that the <code>get</code> method does take more arguments, including the computed value of the specific CSS property it&#8217;s being asked for. <a href='http://api.jquery.com/jQuery.cssHooks/'>The jQuery documentation discusses this in more detail</a>.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s write the <code>set</code> method first. This take two arguments, the element to set the CSS properties on, and the value the user passed. In our case this will be a string of values, eg &#8220;1px 2px 3px 4px&#8221;.</p>

<pre><code>set: function(elem, value) {
  $.each(value.split(&quot; &quot;), function(i, val) {
    elem.style[&quot;margin + directions[i]&quot;] = val;
  });
}</code></pre>

<p>Here we split the values at a space, and loop over them. We use the directions array so for each value the relevant direction property is set. So here we loop over, first setting <code>marginTop</code>, then <code>marginRight</code>, and so on.</p>

<p>The <code>get</code> method will essentially do the reverse, getting each of the individual values and then joining them together into a string:</p>

<pre><code>get: function(elem, value) {
  var res = [];
  $.each(directions, function(i, dir) {
    res.push($.css(elem, &quot;margin&quot; + dir));
  });
  return res.join(&quot; &quot;);
}</code></pre>

<p>We can use <code>$.css</code> to pull out a CSS setting. All this method does is grab the four individual values and add them to an array, which I then join at the end to return a string.</p>

<p>Now there&#8217;s obviously some problems. In CSS we can do <code>margin: 5px 10px</code> to set top/bottom to 5px and left/right to 10px. Currently our implementation doesn&#8217;t do this. Thankfully someone else has already done this. Brandon Aaron&#8217;s <a href='https://github.com/brandonaaron/jquery-cssHooks'>CSS Hooks project</a> has a number of hooks, including a more feature-complete margin implementation.</p>

<p>As I said in the opening, this was a jQuery feature I&#8217;d managed to completely miss, and I bet I&#8217;m not the only one, hence writing this post. <a href='http://jsbin.com/enixej/2/edit'>My margin implementation is up on JSBin</a> if you&#8217;d like to have a play with it, and if you write any interesting CSS Hooks yourself, do let me know in the comments. I can think of a number of scenarios in which they could be very useful.</p>
