<p>I&#8217;ve attended <a href='http://www.webdevconf.com'>WDC</a> for the past two years so when Alex (@alexolder) gave me the chance to speak I couldn&#8217;t say no. Having been at WDC the past two years I can tell you it&#8217;s a great day out and the after party is always great fun too. If you&#8217;re able to make it I&#8217;d highly recommend it. Tickets are only £60 or £40 if you&#8217;re a student. As an extra bonus if you use the discount code &#8220;jackfollowers&#8221; you&#8217;ll get a little bit of money off.</p>

<p>As of yet my talk title is not defined but it will be JavaScript based (obviously).</p>

<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
