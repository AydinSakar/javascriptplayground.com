<p>Recently I found out that I had been nominated for two of <a href='http://www.thenetawards.com/'>.net awards</a>. I&#8217;ve been nominated for &#8220;Young Developer of the Year&#8221; and &#8220;Brilliant Newcomer of the Year&#8221;.</p>

<p>Firstly, you have to be nominated by people to be involved in the first place, so thanks to anyone who put my name forward. It means a lot that people would take the time to do that.</p>

<p>However, that&#8217;s only half the battle! I&#8217;m up against some incredibly clever people and need all the votes I can get! If you can find a spare moment to navigate <a href='http://thenetawards.com'>to the awards site</a>, locate my face and click &#8220;vote&#8221;, that would be awesome.</p>

<p>Finally, I know content has been slow recently, but that&#8217;s not for much longer. Next weekend, on April 6th, the JS Playground turns 1 year old and I&#8217;ve plenty planned to celebrate. There will be lots of new content hitting your screens very soon.</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Jack.</p>
