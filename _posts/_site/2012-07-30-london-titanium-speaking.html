<p>This coming Tuesday, July 31st, I&#8217;m going to be talking at the <a href='http://www.meetup.com/London-Titanium/events/72065822/'>London Titanium Meetup</a>. If you&#8217;re not a Titanium developer please don&#8217;t be put off, I&#8217;m doing a talk on an introduction to Node.js, that is not Titanium based at all. The event is free but spaces are limited so please do sign up on the above URL to register if you plan to attend. The event is free and if you&#8217;re based in London and fancy an evening of JavaScript please do come along, it would be great to chat.</p>

<p>If you&#8217;ve any questions about the event, please do let me know and I&#8217;ll either answer or put you in touch with the event organisers, who should be able to help out. It starts at 7PM on Tuesday and is being held close to Oxford Circus in the centre of London.</p>
