<p>Way back in June last year I published <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/06/exploring-backbone-js-part-2'>part two of my Backbone series</a> and today, at long last, it&#8217;s time to pick up the pieces. I apologise for such a lull between articles and hopefully it wont be quite so long between this and the next episode! I recommend you go back and skim <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/backbone-js-tutorial-1'>Part 1</a> and <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/06/exploring-backbone-js-part-2'>Part 2</a> first just to get up to speed.</p>

<p>Last time I left off we had just written the code to add a new item to our collection. What I&#8217;d like to do today is look at how we might filter down items in a collection. This will set us up nicely for the next article, which will look at Backbone&#8217;s Router in more detail.</p>

<p>Firstly, lets set up the HTML needed to allow a user to filter down by price.</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=&quot;filter&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Less Than&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;text&quot; id=&quot;less-than&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;Filter&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;
&lt;a href=&quot;#&quot; id=&quot;clear-filter&quot;&gt;Clear Filter&lt;/a&gt;</code></pre>

<p>For now we will keep it simple and just let the user search for items less than a particular price.</p>

<p>Next we need to set up some events on our <code>CartCollectionView</code>. If you remember, this view encompasses the entire of our application (its <code>el</code> property is set to <code>&quot;body&quot;</code>), so this is where a lot of our events are set up. If you&#8217;re thinking perhaps this isn&#8217;t the best way, you&#8217;re right. In a future episode when we add a couple more views, we will tidy this up. Add two more events to the <code>events</code> property:</p>

<pre><code>events: {
   &quot;submit #add&quot;: &quot;addItem&quot;,
   &quot;submit #filter&quot;: &quot;filterItems&quot;,
   &quot;click #clear-filter&quot;: &quot;clearFilter&quot;
 }</code></pre>

<p>The methods we need to add to the cart collection view are very straight forward. All they will do is cancel the default action and then call methods on <code>itemView</code>, which is the view that all our items sit within.</p>

<pre><code>filterItems: function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  this.itemView.filterByPrice();
},
clearFilter: function(e) {
  e.preventDefault();
  this.itemView.clearFilter();
}</code></pre>

<p>To filter the items down to those lower than a specific price, here&#8217;s what we need to do:</p>

<ol>
<li>Loop through every element in the collection and see if it matches the filter.</li>

<li>Re-render the item collection view with just those items in.</li>
</ol>

<p>Here&#8217;s the entire code. Give it a read, and I&#8217;ll explain it in depth below.</p>

<pre><code>filterByPrice: function() {
  // first reset the collection
  // but do it silently so the event doesn&#39;t trigger
  this.collection.reset(items, { silent: true });
  var max = parseFloat($(&quot;#less-than&quot;).val(), 10);
  var filtered = _.filter(this.collection.models, function(item) {
    return item.get(&quot;price&quot;) &lt; max;
  });
  // trigger reset again
  // but this time trigger the event so the collection view is rerendered
  this.collection.reset(filtered);
},</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we do is <code>this.collection.reset(items, { silent: true })</code>. This will reset the collection, which is a way of completely changing the items in a collection. Here I reset it to the original array of items, which was stored in <code>items</code>. By passing in <code>{ silent: true }</code>, it means it wont trigger the <code>reset</code> event on the collection. We&#8217;ll use this event later, and then you&#8217;ll see why it&#8217;s important not to trigger it there.</p>

<p>After that we grab the value from the input. I&#8217;m not doing any validation here which is obviously not sensible - but for the purposes of demonstrating Backbone it will do just fine. Then we can use Underscore&#8217;s <code>filter</code> method. This takes an array of items, in this case all the models in the collection, and loops over them. Any that return <code>true</code> from the callback are returned. Therefore after running <code>filter</code>, only elements with a price less than the maximum will be returned. Then we can reset the collection again, but this time to just the filtered items.</p>

<p>Head up to the <code>initialize</code> method of the <code>ItemCollectionView</code> and at the bottom add a binding to the <code>reset</code> method that&#8217;s called on the collection.</p>

<pre><code>initialize: function() {
  this.collection = cartCollection;
  this.render();
  this.collection.on(&quot;reset&quot;, this.render, this);
},</code></pre>

<p>This means when a &#8220;reset&#8221; event is triggered on this view&#8217;s collection, it will call the <code>render</code> method, with the context bound to <code>this</code>, which is the <code>ItemCollectionView</code>. Therefore when we detect the collection has been reset, we can re-render the view. This is why when we reset the collection to contain all elements, we passed in <code>{ silent: true }</code>. Else, we would re-render the item view to all elements just before we filtered it again, which wouldn&#8217;t be very efficient.</p>

<p>Finally, we need to add the code for clearing the filter. The <code>clearFilter</code> method on the <code>ItemCollectionView</code> is very straight forward:</p>

<pre><code>clearFilter: function() {
  $(&quot;#less-than&quot;).val(&quot;&quot;);
  this.collection.reset(items);
}</code></pre>

<p>All it does is clear the input, and reset the collection back to all items.</p>

<p>With that, filtering and clearing the filter should work! There is a pretty big bug though. If you add a new item, and then do some filtering, that new item will not appear. This is because we reset the controller to contain <code>items</code>, which is our original set of items, and doesn&#8217;t include any new items the user added. What we need to do is keep track of when we add a new item, and update our <code>items</code> array to contain those new items. When a collection&#8217;s <code>add</code> method is called, it triggers an <code>add</code> event. Lets use this to solve our bug. Head to where we set up <code>var Cart</code> as our collection of items, and edit it so it looks like so:</p>

<pre><code>var Cart = Backbone.Collection.extend({
  model: Item,
  initialize: function() {
    this.on(&quot;add&quot;, this.updateSet, this);
  },
  updateSet: function() {
    items = this.models;
  }
});</code></pre>

<p>It&#8217;s just a case of updating the original set of items when a new one is added. Now new items that are added can be filtered, and are not lost when we filter and then clear the filter.</p>
