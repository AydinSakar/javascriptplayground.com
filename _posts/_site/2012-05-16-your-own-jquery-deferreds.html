<p>One of the first and most well received posts on the JavaScript Playground <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/jquery-deferreds-tutorial'>introduced jQuery Deferreds</a>, a new feature in jQuery 1.5 to enable us to manage Ajax requests much easier. Today I want to build on that post by showing you how you can construct your own deferreds, enabling you to run callbacks much more efficiently on any piece of code.</p>

<p>Before Deferreds, if you wanted to run some code once you&#8217;d done something trivial, such as fading in a <code>div</code>, you&#8217;d do:</p>

<pre><code>$(&quot;#myDiv&quot;).fadeIn(1000, function() {
	//callback
});</code></pre>

<p>That&#8217;s great, but what if later down in your code you want to see if this div has indeed been faded in? One way round it might be:</p>

<pre><code>var divFadedIn = false;
$(&quot;#myDiv&quot;).fadeIn(1000, function() {
	divFadedIn  = true;
	//callback
});</code></pre>

<p>But that&#8217;s messy and you end up with a lot of variables you&#8217;d much rather avoid and then you get lots of irritating <code>if(divFadedIn)</code> which really irks me.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s where Deferreds come in. In the past post I showed how they work with Ajax calls, but you can also integrate them into your own functions. Say we have a function fade in a div:</p>

<pre><code>var showDiv = function() {
	$(&quot;#fadeIn&quot;).fadeIn(1000);
});</code></pre>

<p>Integrating Deferreds into this is easy:</p>

<ol>
<li>Create a new <code>$.Deferred()</code> object.</li>

<li>Resolve the deferred when the code has been executed.</li>

<li>Return the <code>promise()</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>So the above code now looks like:</p>

<pre><code>var showDiv = function() {
	var def = $.Deferred();
	$(&quot;#fadeIn&quot;).fadeIn(1000, def.resolve);
	return def.promise();	
});</code></pre>

<p>We can then check this has executed like so:</p>

<pre><code>$.when(showDiv()).then(function() {
	console.log(&quot;div faded in&quot;);
});</code></pre>

<p>Which is a pattern you&#8217;ll recognise from the previous post. It&#8217;s exactly how we checked an Ajax request was done.</p>

<p>We can go further though, by allowing our Deferred function to return data. The only change here is to call the method <code>def.resolve()</code>, and pass it an object:</p>

<pre><code>var showDiv = function() {
	var def = $.Deferred();
	$(&quot;#fadeIn&quot;).fadeIn(1000, function() {
		def.resolve({
			elem: this.id
		});
	});
	return def.promise();	
});</code></pre>

<p>We can then get at this data easily:</p>

<pre><code>$.when(showDiv()).then(function(resp) {
	console.log(&quot;div was faded in with response &quot;, resp);
});</code></pre>

<p>Remember, <code>$.when</code> can accept multiple arguments, so if you had 3-4 functions all along these lines, you could do:</p>

<pre><code>$.when(showDiv(), hideOtherDiv(), foo(), bar()).then();</code></pre>

<p>And if you need to check the state of the div later, you can save the promise to a variable to check:</p>

<pre><code>    var divFaded = showDiv();</code></pre>

<p>Although this doesn&#8217;t get rid of my complaint of having to create a few variables, this does tidy it up a bit; we don&#8217;t have to manually set values. It&#8217;s also rare in practice that you&#8217;ll need to do this, at least I&#8217;ve found that for me.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s a lot of power here to be used and there&#8217;s a lot more Deferreds are capable of. In a future post, to be the final part of this 3-part series, I&#8217;ll look at just what else we can use Deferreds for, and some common errors people make when using them.s</p>
