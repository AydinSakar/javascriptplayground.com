<p>Following on from last week&#8217;s <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/javascript-testing-qunit-1'>introduction to QUnit</a> today I want to talk less about how to use QUnit but ways to make it easier to use or integrate it into your development workflow.</p>

<p>A lot of people asked me how to avoid refreshing the QUnit tests page everytime you want to rerun the tests. I was actually using the Mac tool <a href='http://livereload.com/'>LiveReload</a> which is currently on the App Store for Â£6.99. Fear not Windows users, it&#8217;s coming to Windows too, and is currently in early testing stages, with users able to download &amp; test it now, for free. You assign LiveReload a folder to watch and install the browser plugin. Once you&#8217;ve connected the browser to the app, when the app detects a file has changed it will refresh the browsers. This meant whenever I saved my source file, or my tests file, it would rerun the tests. It&#8217;s a lovely solution &amp; I would highly recommend it.</p>

<p>Now, being a developer something I immediately wondered was if I could run tests in the terminal. My answer came in the form of <a href='http://phantomjs.org/'>PhantomJS</a>. There&#8217;s a number of ways to install PhantomJS, the easiest if you&#8217;re on a Mac and use homebrew is to simply run <code>brew install phantomjs</code>. It can be installed on Linux, OS X and Windows. Once you&#8217;ve got that done, you need to get the QUnit JS runner for Phantom, which can be found <a href='https://github.com/ariya/phantomjs/blob/1.2/examples/run-qunit.js'>here on Github</a>. Save that into the root directory. You should then be able to run your tests in the command line by:</p>

<pre><code>phantomjs run-qunit.js path/to/tests.html</code></pre>

<p>In my case, I run the tests through a virtual host and you can see that right now it&#8217;s failing:</p>

<pre><code>phantomjs run-qunit.js http://instagram.jsp/tests.html
&#39;waitFor()&#39; finished in 401ms.
Tests completed in 266 milliseconds.
6 tests of 7 passed, 1 failed.</code></pre>

<p>Why is it failing? Unfortunately you don&#8217;t get shown the failing tests in the output, which is a shame, however it&#8217;s nice for a quick test, as in reality you only need to know about a test if it fails. We can head over to the browser and see:</p>

<p><img alt='' src='http://cl.ly/1q0u1G1h0n0X1E313w0B/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-20%20at%2014.23.49.png' /></p>

<p>So, it seems Instagram changed the URL where this image is stored that we get from our Ajax call. This is what I want to talk about now. When testing, you can&#8217;t rely on making actual external Ajax calls. Why not? Imagine that you&#8217;re on a train, and fancy developing. Without internet, you&#8217;re stuck when it comes to testing. You also, as we&#8217;ve seen above, can&#8217;t rely on certain values staying the same so you can test against them. Here you can see a test that worked fine last time round doesn&#8217;t anymore, all because the URL changed. Our code hasn&#8217;t, at all. What we need is a way to fake Ajax calls &amp; returned data.</p>

<p>Enter <a href='https://github.com/appendto/jquery-mockjax/'>jQuery Mockjax</a>. So, lets mock up a response for the current Ajax call we&#8217;re making. What I&#8217;m going to do is make the API call &amp; copy the data. We can define a new Mocked Ajax call like so (taken from the docs on the Github page):</p>

<pre><code>$.mockjax({
  url: &#39;/restful/fortune&#39;,
  responseTime: 750,
  responseText: {
    status: &#39;success&#39;,
    fortune: &#39;Are you a turtle?&#39;
  }
});</code></pre>

<p>Mockjax will then capture all Ajax requests to <code>/restful/fortune</code> and return the data within <code>responseText</code>. You can also define <code>responseTime</code> to simulate latency. As our response is a fair few lines, I&#8217;m actually going to save this in <code>tests/oembed.json</code> and then we&#8217;ll tell Mockjax to use it shortly. So your <code>tests/oembed.json</code> should look like this:</p>

<pre><code>{
  provider_url: &quot;http://instagram.com/&quot;,
  media_id: &quot;168887029519565501_138023&quot;,
  title: &quot;Drainpipe&quot;,
  url: &quot;http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/9436051c85b011e18cf91231380fd29b_7.jpg&quot;,
  author_name: &quot;joel_hughes&quot;,
  height: 612,
  width: 612,
  version: &quot;1.0&quot;,
  author_url: &quot;http://instagram.com/&quot;,
  author_id: 138023,
  type: &quot;photo&quot;,
  provider_name: &quot;Instagram&quot;
}</code></pre>

<p>Now lets mock our Ajax call. Within the <code>asyncTest</code> call we created last time, at the top, add in this:</p>

<pre><code>$.mockjax({
	url: &#39;http://api.instagram.com/oembed?url=http://instagr.am/p/JYAdvJr0K9/&#39;,
	contentType: &#39;text/json&#39;,
	proxy: &#39;/test/oembed.json&#39;
});</code></pre>

<p>The <code>url</code> property tells Mockjax to capture any Ajax calls to that URL. We then tell it that the response will be JSON, and then use the <code>proxy</code> pattern to define a response file. That means Mockjax will just send the contents of that file back to the app.</p>

<p>Before we run this, make sure you&#8217;ve downloaded the Mockjax source from Github and have included it in your <code>tests.html</code> file, <strong>before</strong> you include our QUnit tests. Now, if you run it, you&#8217;ll still get the error in the test. This is expected because we haven&#8217;t changed the URL to be the new URL Instagram now gives us. If you want to check it&#8217;s working, head to your console. Mockjax logs to the console everytime it captures a request, which is a nice way to test. In my case I see this line:</p>

<pre><code>MOCK GET: http://api.instagram.com/oembed?url=http://instagr.am/p/JYAdvJr0K9/</code></pre>

<p>So I can be confident it works. Now head into the <code>oembed.json</code> file and copy the <code>url</code> property into our <code>equal()</code> call, so it now looks like this:</p>

<pre><code>equal(res.url, &quot;http://distilleryimage5.s3.amazonaws.com/9436051c85b011e18cf91231380fd29b_7.jpg&quot;, &quot;URL returned is correct&quot;);</code></pre>

<p>If you run the tests in the command line, you will see the Mockjax log &amp; that all our tests pass:</p>

<pre><code>phantomjs run-qunit.js http://instagram.jsp/tests.html
MOCK GET: http://api.instagram.com/oembed?url=http://instagr.am/p/JYAdvJr0K9/
&#39;waitFor()&#39; finished in 701ms.
Tests completed in 509 milliseconds.
7 tests of 7 passed, 0 failed.</code></pre>

<p>And if you want to double check, you can load up the tests in your browser and see:</p>

<p><img alt='' src='http://cl.ly/2d2s103o352J030f0s1W/Screen%20Shot%202012-04-20%20at%2014.44.47.png' />.</p>

<p>So, although we didn&#8217;t write any more functionality in this post, we&#8217;ve now got Mockjax set up so we can work on it much easier and not rely on a 3rd party service or having an internet connection when we want to do some testing. I highly recommend using Mockjax for all your Ajax queries.</p>
