<p>A while ago I kicked off a planned series of Backbone.js tutorials with <a href='http://javascriptplayground.com/blog/2012/04/backbone-js-tutorial-1'>Part 1</a>, which introduced Backbone as we set up a &#8220;shopping cart&#8221; - albeit an overly simplified one. Although it&#8217;s been too long coming, today I&#8217;ve got part 2! I ended part 1 with some bullet points as things I wanted to cover:</p>

<ul>
<li>How do I add to a collection after initialising it?</li>

<li>How can I show a filtered set of my objects?</li>

<li>How do I let a user add a new item?</li>

<li>How do I unit test my Backbone applications?</li>

<li>Can I use Backbone.js with CoffeeScript?</li>
</ul>

<p>Whilst I wont be covering them all today, I want to take on the 1st and 3rd bullet point, as they go hand in hand. So today, we&#8217;ll edit our code to include a very simple form that lets us add a new item. Whilst this isn&#8217;t so much in keeping with the shopping cart idea, it&#8217;s the easiest way to demonstrate how to make the changes. In the upcoming parts we will start to model this into the shopping cart application.</p>

<p><em>One thing that has become apparent is that in Backbone there a lot of different ways often to go about the same thing. I&#8217;m still learning Backbone too, so if you would have done anything that I do today differently, please let me know in the comments.</em></p>

<p>We need to make some changes to our existing code base. Firstly, in the comments of the prior article it was pointed out to me that setting <code>el</code> to be <code>$(&quot;#yourcart&quot;)</code> was bad. What I should do is set <code>el</code> to <code>&quot;#yourcart&quot;</code>, and then Backbone gives us <code>$el</code>, which is the same as <code>$(el)</code> which of course is <code>$(&quot;#yourcart&quot;)</code>.</p>

<p>Now, the way Backbone works in terms of events, is that you bind an event to an element using the form:</p>

<pre><code>events: {
	&quot;event selector&quot;:&quot;method&quot;
}</code></pre>

<p>This can be any element, however the element has to reside within the View&#8217;s objects, which is all the elements in whatever you specified as <code>el</code> when declaring the view. <em>This had me stuck for ages!</em>.</p>

<p>There are many ways to get around this, but before I cover my solution, I&#8217;ve added this simple form just after the <code>&lt;body&gt;</code> tag:</p>

<pre><code>&lt;form id=&quot;add&quot;&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Title&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id=&quot;title&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;label&gt;Price&lt;/label&gt;
  &lt;input id=&quot;price&quot; type=&quot;text&quot; /&gt;
  &lt;input type=&quot;submit&quot; value=&quot;save&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/form&gt;	</code></pre>

<p>My first solution was to update the <code>CartCollectionView</code> to just have <code>body</code> as its <code>el</code> and then save another for the wrapper around the items, like so:</p>

<pre><code>var CartCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: &quot;body&quot;,
  $item_wrap: $(&quot;#yourcart&quot;),</code></pre>

<p>However, this seemed not very modular. Each view should deal with just one thing. I either needed another view to deal with the individual item wrapper, or another view to deal with the app as an entity. In essence, both lead you to a similar solution. I chose the first, so <code>CartCollectionView</code> would become the view for the entire app, and I created <code>ItemCollectionView</code> to deal with the HTML for listing all the items.</p>

<p>From here, <code>CartCollectionView</code> became:</p>

<pre><code>var CartCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: &quot;body&quot;,
  events: {
    &quot;submit #add&quot;: &quot;addItem&quot;
  },
  initialize: function() {
    this.itemView = new ItemCollectionView();
  },
  addItem: function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    this.itemView.addItem();
  }
});</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, I set the <code>el</code> to just be <code>body</code>, so it encompasses everything. I then declare the events object. This simply states that when a <code>submit</code> event is triggered on <code>#add</code> (I gave the <code>form</code> that ID), call the <code>addItem</code> method. You can have as many of these as you want, in that format.</p>

<p>The <code>initialize</code> is also simplified, as all it does is create a new <code>ItemCollectionView</code>, which I&#8217;ll show you shortly.</p>

<p>The main new piece of code is the <code>addItem</code> method, but all this does is use jQuery&#8217;s <code>preventDefault()</code> to stop the form firing, and then call <code>addItem</code> on the <code>itemView</code>, which is what I stored the <code>new ItemCollectionView()</code> as.</p>

<p>Moving onto the <code>ItemCollectionView</code>, most of it you&#8217;ll recognise, all I&#8217;ve done is move a lot of the code that was in the <code>CartCollectionView</code> over:</p>

<pre><code>var ItemCollectionView = Backbone.View.extend({
  el: &#39;#yourcart&#39;,
  initialize: function() {
    this.collection = cartCollection;
    this.render();
  },
  render: function() {
    this.$el.html(&quot;&quot;);
    this.collection.each(function(item) {
      this.renderItem(item);
    }, this);
  },
  renderItem: function(item) {
    var itemView = new ItemView({model: item});
    this.$el.append(itemView.render().el);
  },
  addItem: function() {
    var data = {};
    $(&quot;#add&quot;).children(&quot;input[type=&#39;text&#39;]&quot;).each(function(i, el) {
      data[el.id] = $(el).val();
    });
    var newItem = new Item(data);
    this.collection.add(newItem);
    this.renderItem(newItem);
  }	  	  
});</code></pre>

<p>The only piece of code here that&#8217;s new is the <code>addItem</code> method. The first thing it does it loop through all the text fields of the form and store the values to the new <code>data</code> object, using each input&#8217;s <code>id</code> as the key (I set the <code>id</code> to &#8220;title&#8221; and &#8220;price&#8221; on the inputs). This builds us a simple object that we can now generate an Item from using <code>new Item(data)</code>. From there we add that item to the collection and then call <code>renderItem</code>, which creates the HTML for an item &amp; then adds it to the <code>#yourcart</code> wrapper.</p>

<p>And that, as they say, is a wrap! At first I have to confess Backbone&#8217;s way of doing this confused me, but after I managed to get my head around it it did begin to make sense. As always, you can find the code <a href='https://github.com/jackfranklin/JS-Playground-Backbone/tree/tutorial2'>on Github</a>, and if you have any questions, please leave a comment. As I said earlier, if you&#8217;d have done this differently, I&#8217;d love to know, as there are a few different approaches. I will be amending the article with other solutions if they come up.</p>
