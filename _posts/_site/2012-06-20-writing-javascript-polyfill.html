<p>In today&#8217;s tutorial I want to introduce you to the concepts behind polyfills, a word you see used a lot in today&#8217;s JS world. I&#8217;ll demonstrate just what a polyfill is and then write one ourselves.</p>

<p>A polyfill is a piece of code that provides a fallback if a certain feature doesn&#8217;t exist within that browser&#8217;s JS engine. Polyfills usually follow a pattern. First, they check to see if the function they implement exists, and then we only write our fallback implementation if we have to.</p>

<p>There are multiple polyfills out there for mutliple functions. The website <a href='http://html5please.com/'>HTML5 Please</a> is very useful for finding polyfills to do a particular job.</p>

<p>Now, lets get to our own implementation. I should note as this point that this implementation is by no means going to be a fully fledged, comprehensive one. At the end, I&#8217;ll link you to the Mozilla Documentation Network (or MDN) page that contains a hugely comprehensive &amp; fully featured polyfill, should you require it.</p>

<p>Today we&#8217;ll be implementing <code>Array forEach</code>, which was introduced in JavaScript 1.6, ECMAScript 5th edition. In reality, this is actually a very well supported feature, but I&#8217;ve chosen it more for the fact that it&#8217;s a fairly simple implementation.</p>

<p>The first thing we need to do is see if the method has been natively implemented. We do this by checking to see if <code>Array.prototype.forEach != undefined</code>. If it is indeed undefined, we can continue. What this function does is iterate through all items within an array and call a function on them. This function is passed 3 arguments: the item, the index &amp; the array it&#8217;s iterating on. It&#8217;s also possible to pass in to <code>forEach</code> a second value, which will be used as the value for <code>this</code> within the callback.</p>

<p>With that in mind, lets implement it! At this point, I&#8217;m presuming the method is not natively supported, and we need to implement it. Our first line simply defines the function:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback, thisArg) {</code></pre>

<p>Next, we need to check if <code>callback</code> is a function or not, and throw a <code>TypeError</code> if it&#8217;s not:</p>

<pre><code>if(typeof(callback) !== &quot;function&quot;) {
    throw new TypeError(callback + &quot; is not a function!&quot;);
}</code></pre>

<p>Once we&#8217;ve got this far, we know that the callback is a valid function, so now all that&#8217;s left to do is loop through our array. Firstly, I save the length of the array:</p>

<pre><code>var len = this.length;</code></pre>

<p>Then we can loop through:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    //callback here
}</code></pre>

<p>Remember, we have to pass three things into the callback. So we <em>could</em> do:</p>

<pre><code>callback(this[i], i, this)</code></pre>

<p>But how do we go about applying the value of <code>this</code> within the callback? We can use JavaScript&#8217;s <code>call()</code> method (<a href='https://developer.mozilla.org/en/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Function/call'>MDN Link</a>).</p>

<p>The first argument of <code>call</code> is the value of <code>this</code> within the function, and then every argument following it will be passed to the function. So, we have to do:</p>

<pre><code>for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    callback.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this)
}</code></pre>

<p>Your next question might be, what if <code>thisArg</code> is undefined? In which case, the value of <code>this</code> will become the global object, which is what it would become anyway if we&#8217;d done <code>callback(this[i], i, this)</code>, so that&#8217;s actually the implementation we want.</p>

<p>And with that, we&#8217;re done! Here&#8217;s the entire code:</p>

<pre><code>Array.prototype.forEach = function(callback, thisArg) {
  if(typeof(callback) !== &quot;function&quot;) {
    throw new TypeError(callback + &quot; is not a function!&quot;);
  }
  var len = this.length;
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; len; i++) {
    callback.call(thisArg, this[i], i, this)
  }
}</code></pre>

<p>As a quick test, try:</p>

<pre><code>var arr = [1,2,3];
arr.forEach(function(item, index, th) {
  console.log(item, index, th);
});</code></pre>

<p>You should see this output:</p>

<pre><code>1 0 [ 1, 2, 3 ]
2 1 [ 1, 2, 3 ]
3 2 [ 1, 2, 3 ]</code></pre>

<p>We can also test setting the value of <code>this</code> within the callback:</p>

<pre><code>arr.forEach(function(item, index, th) {
  console.log(this);
}, {});</code></pre>

<p>Here I set it to just an empty object, <code>{}</code>. In your console, you should see:</p>

<pre><code>{}
{}
{}</code></pre>

<p>Which is just what we&#8217;re after. Hopefully this has helped clear up any confusion over just what a polyfill is, and the general methodology behind going about writing one. As always, any questions or feedback, please leave a comment or grab me on Twitter.
