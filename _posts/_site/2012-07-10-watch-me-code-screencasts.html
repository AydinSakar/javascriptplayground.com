<p>I have had a lot of tweets recently asking about how I work, the tools I use, the workflow I&#8217;ve adopted and lots of related questions. I regularly tweet about tools and what I&#8217;m up to; some people get annoyed by it but to me one of the best things you can do is to see how other developers do things &amp; integrate bits into a workflow that suits you.</p>

<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no one definitive workflow for everyone, but I&#8217;ve been asked enough times to show mine that I&#8217;m going to do some screencasts titled &#8220;Watch me Code&#8221;. In these I&#8217;ll code up a simple JavaScript project as I would in real life, and show you just how I go about doing things. This will include things like:</p>

<ul>
<li>how I use Vim</li>

<li>command line JS tools (Grunt, etc)</li>

<li>Using Git</li>

<li>Debugging with the Chrome dev tools</li>

<li>TDD with Jasmine / Mocha / QUnit / others</li>

<li>CoffeeScript development</li>
</ul>

<p>As there&#8217;s a lot to cover, these will be split over multiple screencasts. What I&#8217;m looking for from you lovely readers is two things:</p>

<ul>
<li>What should I code up? If there&#8217;s a plugin you&#8217;d like to see created or a library made, then let me know! I&#8217;ll do it for free, as long as you&#8217;re happy that it gets put on Github in all its glory.</li>

<li>What specifically would you like me to talk about?</li>
</ul>

<p>In these screencasts I wont be explaining how every line of code works, I&#8217;ll explain bits but I&#8217;ll focus more on the tools I&#8217;m using, tricks &amp; tips I&#8217;ve picked up, and so on.</p>

<p>So, the power is in your hands&#8230;</p>
