<p>For those who don&#8217;t follow me on Twitter or perhaps missed it, one of the reasons I&#8217;ve not been blogging on JSPlayground as much recently is down to writing for other sites too.</p>

<p>Last week .net magazine published my article on the <a href='http://www.netmagazine.com/features/essential-javascript-top-five-script-loaders'>Top 5 JavaScript Script Loaders</a>. It covers Yepnope, Require and some others too so if you&#8217;ve been looking at script loaders or wanted to for a while, hopefully this article might be of use to you.</p>

<p>Another reason I&#8217;ve not been blogging as much is because I&#8217;ve signed a book deal with <a href='http://www.apress.com/'>Apress</a> to write a new book titled &#8220;Beginning jQuery&#8221;. This will hopefully take a developer from jQuery novice to someone who&#8217;s comfortable entirely with the library and its more complex applications. At this stage three chapters have been written, although there&#8217;s plenty more to be written. The book is going to be out in early 2013 and there will be a couple of copies on the JSPlayground to be won.</p>

<p>Finally don&#8217;t forget that I&#8217;m speaking at <a href='http://2012.webdevconf.com/'>WebDevConf</a> on October 19th. I&#8217;m going to be talking all about writing better jQuery, with a specific focus to not tying yourself so tightly to any DOM structure. Tickets are just £60 (£40 for students) and the discount code &#8220;jackfollowers&#8221; will get you an additional 10% off. It would be great to meet some new faces so please do come along.</p>
