<p>Today I spent a bit of time updating the site, and as such it seemed like a good time to write a small blog post with some updates.</p>

<p><strong>Disqus</strong></p>

<p>I have now moved site comments over to Disqus. This does lose all previous comments (they are still in the DB, just not visible) which is a shame, but I was finding it hard to keep up with the old system. Disqus also offers a much nicer interface and tools to enable much better discussions to take place within the comments, so I think this will really help me keep up to date with comments and reply in a much more organised and clearer fashion.</p>

<p><strong>The Book</strong></p>

<p>I am still hard at work with my book! There are now just two chapters left, and the end is in sight. Once the book is done I hope to be able to return to my previous writing frequency on this site. You can also <a href='http://www.amazon.co.uk/Beginning-jQuery-Jack-Franklin/dp/1430249323/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1353848521&amp;sr=8-1'>preorder the book now!</a> from Amazon. It&#8217;s out on February 6th, 2013.</p>

<p><strong>Open Source</strong></p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been working ons ome open source libraries that some readers might find interesting: <a href='https://github.com/jackfranklin/jQuery-Form-Validator'>jQuery Form Validator</a>, <a href='http://github.com/jackfranklin/nodefetch'>Nodefetch</a> and <a href='https://github.com/alphagov/magna-charta'>Magna Charta</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Content is coming</strong></p>

<p>Tomorrow I&#8217;m excited to post the second screencast I&#8217;ve recorded. I&#8217;ve been practicing screencasts and I&#8217;m feeling more confident now, so hopefully in the future the split of screencast vs article will be a bit more even.</p>

<p><strong>Feedback Welcome</strong></p>

<p>As always, if you have any feedback, or requests, or would like to write for the site, please do just get in touch. I&#8217;d be happy to chat.</p>
