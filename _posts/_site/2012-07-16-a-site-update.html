<p>As some of you will have noticed unfortunately posting has slowed in the past few weeks, and I just wanted to write a quick post to explain why. It&#8217;s largely been down to starting a new job and moving house to a new city, so everything&#8217;s been a bit hectic. I am pleased to say it&#8217;s all settled down now, so I hope to resume posting at least twice a week in the very near future. I&#8217;ve also been occupied with some other JS related projects which are very exciting, but unfortunately I can&#8217;t say anything just yet.</p>

<p>In other news, I;m looking for your feedback as always on what to write. Some people have told me articles are too long so I will be making an effort to do smaller, more targeted posts alongside longer ones. The list of upcoming topics includes:</p>

<ul>
<li>Introduction to Spine.js</li>

<li>Creating your own NPM / Jam packages</li>

<li>Testing with Sinon.js</li>

<li>Watch Me Code Screencasts (working title)</li>

<li>Angular.js</li>

<li>Writing Node.js apps with CoffeeScript</li>

<li>Creating Chrome &amp; Firefox extensions</li>

<li>Frisby.js</li>
</ul>

<p>And lots more. As always I&#8217;m always looking for suggestions on what you&#8217;d like to see written so please do let me know if you have any suggestions.</p>
